        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            This webservice tool was built on the idea that we as consumers need more guidance in the expertise of stocks and knowing when to buy/sell them.
            As a background to using the tool, you must have Django installed, as well as Python.  The user login information is stored on Django's builtin user data table.
            Once you have Django and Python installed, the user can run the Webservice by entering the following command into the command line FROM THE DIRECTORY WHERE
            THE SOURCE PROJECT FILES ARE SAVED:  'python manage.py runserver'
        </p>
        <p>
            After connecting to the server, the user can enter the URL given in the command prompt window and use their credentials to log in.  If first time user, then use admin as user
            and password as password.  This will open up the admin interface where the user can add themselves as a new user.
        </p>
